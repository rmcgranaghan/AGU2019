_Feedback from the event_

- "...the topic is important. It would be nice to see this session brought into the AGU program at a more favorable hour, as I think the conversation deserves more attention than we were able to get for a 6:15 panel discussion." -Bill Diamond [SETI Institute](https://www.seti.org/)
