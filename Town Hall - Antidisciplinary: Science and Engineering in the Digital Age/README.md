### Abstract:
Antidisciplinary is "about working in spaces that simply do not fit into any existing academic discipline—a specific field of study with its own particular words, frameworks, and methods” [[Ito, 2014](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2014/10/02/antidisciplinar.html)], and it indicates profound new opportunities to transform research across all fields of science and engineering.  Fields primed to benefit from the antidisciplinary ideal are those grappling with the co-evolution of: 1) drastic data growth; 2) increased sophistication of data-intensive computing capabilities; and 3) data science technologies. The trend is a shifting digital and data landscape and the impact is felt across all fields of science and engineering.  Community-wide, we face an exciting opportunity and important imperative to transform research by connecting a wider diversity of expertise. 

Thus, the Earth and space sciences are a fantastic proving ground through which to explore new antidisciplinary approaches, and exciting efforts across the community are navigating this undefined space. 

This town hall will provide a brief introduction to current efforts to transform the fields of Earth and space science through the application of the antidisciplinary ethos. It will feature highlights, insights, and practical advice from particularly impactful antidisciplinary projects and groups. The following is a list of groups and projects that will provide updates and shape discussion:
[The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/)
Within industry:
     [Google Making and Science Team](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNLuO_8S78nBIXnMC2sbIQ)
Within NASA:
     [The Frontier Development Laboratory](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/)
     The Jet Propulsion Laboratory Data Science Working Group and Mission Formulation Office
     The Goddard Space Flight Center Data Analytics and Machine Learning Task Group
[The National Science Foundation (NSF) Convergence Institutes](https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/convergence/index.jsp)
[The SETI Institute](https://www.seti.org/)

Our goals will be to introduce innovative, non-traditional approaches to discovery in the Earth and space sciences and to spark novel ideas and research vistas. Our audience will be decidedly broad, covering individuals, groups, and projects whose curiosity takes them beyond traditional research boundaries.


### Agenda:
1. 6:15-6:25 PM Ryan McGranaghan (ASTRA LLC; NASA): Opening remarks
2. 6:25-6:35 PM Ufuoma Ovienmhada (MIT Media Lab Space Exploration Initiative and Space Enabled): What is antidisciplinary?
    *  Introduce innovative, non-traditional approaches to discovery in the Earth and space sciences and to spark novel ideas and research vistas
3. 6:35-6:45 PM TBD (Committee Member, NAS Committee on the Science of Team Science): Effectively constructing antidisciplinary projects
4. 6:45-6:55 PM Chaitan Baru (Senior Advisor for the NSF Convergence Accelerator; Senior Data Science Advisor University of California San Diego): Incentivizing antidisciplinary
5. 6:55-7:15 PM Bridging the gap between the ideas and the applications
    * Bill Diamond (The SETI Institute & NASA Frontier Development Laboratory): 
    * Cat Allman (Google Making & Science Program Manager; Sci Foo Coordinator)
    * Bryan Biegel (NASA HQ; NASA Digital Transformation)
6. Q&A as time permits (allowing audience to dictate direction of conversation)


### Objectives:
* Create a new conversation around antidisciplinary in the context of advancing discovery (in this case applied to the geosciences, but reaching more broadly to any endeavor)
    * Introduce innovative, non-traditional approaches to discovery in the Earth and space sciences and to spark novel ideas and research vistas
* Tie the [New Frontier](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JA024835) to the ideas in [‘Enhancing the Effectiveness of Team Science’](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/19007/enhancing-the-effectiveness-of-team-science)
* Energize the pioneers for the [’next generation PI’](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/new-pi-resources)
    * Create a conversation around and help shape the definition of the next generation PI
    * Inspire a new wave of next generation PIs
* Grow the connections between academia, the public sector, and industry needed to advance scientific frontiers and provide actionable information:
    * Successful examples of partnerships (reveal the best practices)
    * Typical roles and responsibilities that each group can play in partnerships
    * Logistics of coordinating these partnerships from inception through delivery
